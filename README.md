# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repo houses implementations of different data structures and algorithms.
I use this to learn languages by implementing them in a new language.

## Overview

I probably won't everything for every language, mostly because I might not like that particular language very much.

Overview of possible the data structures:

- list based:
  - single linked list
  - double linked list
  - stack
  - queue
- tree/graph based:
  - binary tree
  - binary search tree
  - trie
  - graph
  - b-tree
  - red-black-tree
- array based:
  - heap
  - hashmap
  - hashset
  - array buffer
  - ring buffer

Some algos:

- breadth first search
- depth first search
- inverting a binary tree
- bubble sort
- quick sort
- insertion sort
- merge sort
- huffman coding compression
- n-queens
- graph cycle detection
- Djikstra's shorted path

Languages I have done this for - at least in parts - or may be doing it for in the future:

- [ ] C
- [ ] C++
- [x] Go
- [ ] Dart
- [ ] F#
- [ ] Fortran
- [ ] Haskell
- [ ] Javascript/Typescript
- [ ] Julia
- [ ] Kotlin
- [ ] Lua
- [ ] Nim
- [ ] Ocaml
- [ ] Odin
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] Scala
- [ ] Swift
- [ ] Zig
